            <p><strong>English tartans</strong> have a fascinating trajectory, intertwining with the better-known <strong>Scottish tartan</strong> tradition yet developing a character of their own. Although <strong>tartan</strong> is primarily identified with Scotland, England’s engagement with tartan spans from ancient use of <strong>checkered cloth</strong> by <strong>Celtic</strong> peoples to a modern revival of regional and national patterns. This comprehensive overview examines the emergence and development of tartans in England – from historical origins and regional examples to influences of the <strong>textile industry</strong>, expressions of <strong>national identity</strong>, and contemporary <strong>design movements</strong> – all while preserving every detail of the rich historical narrative.</p>

            <h2>Ancient History</h2>
            

            
            <div class="section-text">
                <p>Long before clan tartans became a symbol of Scottish Highland clans, the peoples of what is now England were familiar with tartan-like patterns. <strong>Celtic</strong> inhabitants of the British Isles wore <strong>checkered</strong> garments; a reddish checkered tunic known as a <strong>bracca</strong> was documented among Celtic tribes, and the very word reflects its appearance. (The Welsh term <strong>brech</strong> and Gaelic <strong>breac</strong> both mean “checkered” or “speckled,” indicating that woven checks were part of ancient Celtic textile traditions.) Notably, the oldest physical evidence of tartan in Britain – a wool fragment found near Falkirk – dates to around the 3rd century AD. This fragment’s simple black-and-white checked pattern is identical to the traditional <strong>Northumberland tartan</strong>, suggesting such patterns were known in Roman-era Britain. Indeed, what later came to be called the Northumberland or “<strong>Shepherd’s Plaid</strong>” tartan was originally woven from the natural black and white fleece of sheep, without dyes, as a practical checkered cloth for shepherds.</p>
<p>Through the medieval and early modern periods, tartan or plaids were not a mainstream feature of English dress. Tartan weaving and wearing largely persisted in the Scottish Highlands, where it became associated with clan identity, while in England it remained rare outside of border regions. Descriptions from the 16th–17th centuries note Highlanders wearing “mottled” or “sundrie coloured” plaids, but in England such boldly checked textiles held little cultural prominence. This began to change in the 18th and 19th centuries when tartan’s symbolic power grew – ironically due in part to English intervention. After the Jacobite Rising, the British government’s <strong>Dress Act of 1746</strong> banned Highland dress (including tartans) in Scotland in an attempt to suppress the clan culture. The ban was repealed in 1782, thanks largely to the lobbying of the <strong>Highland Society of London</strong> (an <strong>organisation</strong> of Scottish nobles in England), which sought to restore pride in Highland traditions. Thus, even as tartan was becoming a symbol of Scottish heritage, some of its champions were based in England, setting the stage for a broader adoption of tartan in Britain.</p>

            <h2>Regional Examples</h2>
            

            
            <div class="section-text">
                <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, distinct tartans emerged to represent various regions of England, often inspired by local heritage or as modern creations to celebrate regional identity. One early example is the <strong>Northumberland tartan</strong>, also known as the Border tartan or <strong>Shepherd’s Plaid</strong>. This simple black-and-white check is steeped in history: it was traditionally worn by shepherds along the Anglo-Scottish Borders and later became associated with the Percy family, Dukes of Northumberland, who adopted it as the official tartan for their pipers in 1760. Textile historians even traced this pattern to the 3rd-century Falkirk fragment, indicating the design was known as far back as Roman times. Over the years, Northumberland’s shepherd’s check was reproduced using vegetable dyes in natural greens and browns, but its core symbolism lies in its antiquity and rustic origins – a direct link to the landscape and livelihoods of northern England.</p>
<p>Moving southwest, <strong>Cornwall</strong> provides a notable case of a modern tartan tradition invented to express <strong>Celtic identity</strong> within England. The <strong>Cornish National Tartan</strong> was first created in 1963 by Cornish poet E.E. Morton Nance. Morton Nance explicitly viewed tartan as part of the heritage of <em>all</em> Celtic peoples, not just the Scots. He designed Cornwall’s tartan with <strong>colours</strong> rich in symbolism: a white cross on black background taken from <strong>Saint Piran’s flag</strong> (the flag of Cornwall) to represent Cornish patron saint St. Piran and the mining heritage, black and gold for the ancient kings of Dumnonia, red for the legs and beak of the <strong>Cornish chough</strong> (the national bird of Cornwall), and blue for the surrounding sea. The Cornish National tartan quickly became a proud emblem of Cornish identity, worn at Celtic gatherings (Morton Nance himself debuted it at the 1963 Celtic Congress). Its popularity led to the creation of a variant <strong>Cornish Hunting Tartan</strong> in 1984 – a subdued version with a dark green base, incorporating all the same colours in a muted form. This hunting tartan, designed collaboratively by the Redwood and Charnock families, was intended as a less bright alternative for everyday wear. It preserved the symbolism of the original while adding its own twist: the use of <strong>royal blue and gold</strong>, said to reflect the colours worn by Cornish wrestlers, connecting to another aspect of local culture.</p>
<p>Inspired by the success of Cornwall’s tartans, other counties followed suit in the late 20th century. In the 1980s, residents of <strong>Devon</strong> — Cornwall’s neighbour — commissioned their own tartan. The <strong>Devon tartan</strong> (sometimes called “Devon Original”) was designed by Roy Sheard in 1989–1990, directly motivated by the enthusiasm for Cornwall’s St. Piran tartan. Woven at Coldharbour Mill, it was formally presented to the Mayor of Barnstaple in 1991 as Devon’s district tartan. A contemporary poem lauds how the tartan “retrieved” Devon’s beauty in its weave, indicating that the colours were chosen to evoke the county’s landscape — from its green countryside to perhaps the sea blue of its two coasts — and to celebrate Devon’s heritage. Further north, <strong>Yorkshire</strong> — England’s largest historic county — received its own tartan in 2005. <strong>The Spirit of Yorkshire</strong> tartan was designed by John C.C. Buckingham of Simpsons of Skipton, aiming to capture the beauty of Yorkshire and the hard work and enterprise of its people. While not an “ancient” tartan, this design served as a modern tribute to regional pride, and its registered description notes that it <strong>recognises</strong> the determination of Yorkshire folk.</p>
<p>Even major cities have embraced tartan. Notably, the <strong>City of London</strong> – perhaps the most unexpected place to find a tartan – now has an official tartan of its own. In 2012, the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Roger Gifford (an enthusiast with Scottish roots), approved the <strong>City of London tartan</strong> for use in his office. This civic tartan incorporates the colours of England’s patron saint and the City’s heraldry: it features the red and white of <strong>St. George’s Cross</strong>, together with silver-grey derived from the City of London’s coat of arms. The design was registered with the Scottish Register of Tartans, making it an “official” tartan for England’s capital city. Although initially intended for use by City officials, practically anyone may wear it – a reminder that tartan patterns, even those with nominal restrictions, are ultimately open for all to enjoy. From northern frontiers like Northumberland and regional identities in Cornwall, to counties like Devon and Yorkshire and even the heart of London, English locales have adopted tartans as symbols of local heritage in the modern era.</p>

            <h2>Textile Industry</h2>
            

            
            <div class="section-text">
                <p>The proliferation of tartans beyond Scotland was closely tied to developments in the <strong>textile industry</strong> and changing technology. By the time tartan fever struck in the 19th century (during the reign of <strong>Queen Victoria</strong>), Britain – including the industrial heartlands of England – had the capacity to produce tartan on a large scale. The <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong> introduced <strong>power looms</strong> and mass production to weaving, which meant tartan patterns no longer had to be handwoven in the Highlands; they could be manufactured in mills anywhere. English textile mills in places like Lancashire and Yorkshire were well-positioned to contribute to the booming tartan trade. Indeed, the mid-19th century saw natural plant dyes giving way to <strong>synthetic chemical dyes</strong>, which were easier to use and allowed for brighter, more vivid tartan colours. This technological shift greatly expanded tartan’s palette and popularity. As one source notes, by the 1850s the advent of chemical dyes produced stronger, darker colours and helped fuel a “booming tartan industry” to meet growing demand. No longer limited by the local availability of plants or minerals for dyes, weavers (Scottish and English alike) could create eye-catching tartans in any hue, feeding a craze for tartan cloth that spread across Britain and beyond.</p>
<p>The <strong>commercialisation</strong> of tartan was significantly influenced by English enterprise and patronage. After the repeal of the tartan ban in 1782, tartan rapidly transitioned from a banned rebel cloth to a celebrated symbol of Scottish (and British) identity. Market forces took over: enterprising businesses (some based in England) <strong>realised</strong> that there was money to be made in tartan fashion and souvenirs. By the 1820s, tailors in Edinburgh and London were responding to a surge of interest. The visit of King George IV to Edinburgh in 1822 – orchestrated by Sir Walter Scott – famously <strong>popularised</strong> tartan attire among the elites. Sir Walter Scott himself donned tartan trews (trousers) on occasion in England; one account even claims he wore Northumberland checked trousers in London, sparking “checks” as a trendy pattern in fashionable society. Production scaled up to meet such trends. Firms like William Wilson &amp; Sons of Bannockburn (Scotland) catalogued dozens of setts, and London outlets eagerly sold tartan garments and fabrics to English customers caught up in the romantic Highland vogue.</p>
<p>By Victorian times, <strong>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert</strong> further boosted tartan’s profile through their personal enthusiasm. They purchased Balmoral Castle in 1848 and redecorated it extensively in tartan; Prince Albert personally designed the <strong>Balmoral tartan</strong> (a grey-based sett still used exclusively by the royal family) and Queen Victoria commissioned tartan garments, carpets, and décor, effectively turning Balmoral into a showcase of plaid. Their patronage underscored tartan’s status as a fashionable fabric. Under royal influence, tartan moved from Highland regiments into mainstream British fashion, with England’s textile mills helping supply the cloth. The once-humble checked wool of Gaelic peasants thus became a coveted product of a modern industry. The arrival of aniline dyes in the late 19th century made tartans even more vibrant and varied, and by this time tartan was being woven not just in Scotland but in English mills and around the world. As <strong>artificial dyes and power looms</strong> proliferated, tartan patterns also became easier to reproduce anywhere, breaking the regional link between tartans and their local natural dyes. This technological democratisation meant that tartans could be (and were) created for new purposes – companies, events, cities – far from their Highland origins. In short, industrial innovation, much of it centred in Britain and often driven by English manufacturers or entrepreneurs, was crucial in transforming tartan from a local tradition into a global commodity.</p>

            <h2>National Identity</h2>
            

            
            <div class="section-text">
                <p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, tartan evolved into a potent symbol of <strong>national and regional identities</strong> – and not just for Scotland. For the English, tartan was initially an object of fascination and romanticism, tied to Britain’s view of Highland Scotland. Over time, however, certain tartans came to be used in expressions of English identity as well, merging Scottish tradition with English symbolism. A striking modern example is the <strong>English National Tartan</strong>, a pattern designed to represent England in the same way that Scotland, Ireland, and Wales each have national tartans. The English National Tartan is woven in bold blue, red and yellow tones with white and purple over-stripes. Its design encodes national icons: it deliberately embeds the red cross of <strong>St. George</strong> (England’s patron saint) in its pattern, and incorporates royal purple lines symbolising over a thousand years of English monarchical tradition. In essence, it takes a Scottish medium – tartan – and infuses it with distinctly English heraldic imagery. The very creation of an English National Tartan underscores an important point: tartan, though Scottish in origin, has been embraced as a broader British heritage symbol that English people can also claim and reinterpret.</p>
<p>Historically, the English did not have clan tartans, but they did use tartan to express loyalty and unity in other ways. Military uniforms offer one example. Many <strong>British Army</strong> regiments recruited from Scotland or Ireland continued to wear tartan trews or kilts in their dress uniforms well into the 19th century. English-raised regiments did not typically have tartan uniforms (since tartan was seen as Highland dress), but when Highland regiments became part of the British Army, their tartans – such as Government Sett or <strong>Black Watch tartan</strong> – became part of the British military identity, <strong>honoured</strong> across the UK. At court, Queen Victoria’s love of tartan set trends that trickled into English society. It became fashionable for English nobles to decorate country homes in tartan and to wear tartan shawls or trews at social functions, signaling their participation in the mystique of the Highlands. Prince Albert’s <strong>Balmoral tartan</strong> was a royal tartan but effectively also an English one, since it was designed by a German prince for a British (largely English-led) monarchy. Likewise, the widespread use of the bright red <strong>Royal Stewart tartan</strong> as a sort of “universal” tartan owes much to its adoption by the royal family – and it’s now commonly worn by people of all backgrounds across the UK as a patriotic British symbol.</p>
<p>In England proper, tartan often signifies a sense of <strong>cultural crossover</strong> – an acknowledgment of the shared history within the United Kingdom. For instance, when English people wear a tartan kilt to a wedding or a cultural event, they may be signaling British unity or personal ancestral links to Scotland, Ireland, or Wales. It’s uncommon for someone to wear a specific Scottish clan’s tartan without a personal connection (that would “raise eyebrows,” as one curator noted), but there are many non-clan tartans available for general use. In fact, contrary to popular myth, there are no strict rules preventing anyone (English or otherwise) from wearing most tartans – nearly all tartan designs are unrestricted and can be worn by anyone who likes them. This openness has allowed tartan to become part of English life in subtle ways: from school uniforms with tartan skirts, to Anglican church choirs donning tartan cassocks, to the choice of <strong>tartan accessories</strong> (ties, scarves, etc.) by English individuals as fashion statements that nod to a broader British heritage.</p>
<p>Interestingly, English involvement was crucial in the great <strong>Highland Revival</strong> of the 19th century that cemented tartan as a national symbol. As mentioned, the <strong>Highland Society of London</strong> (founded 1778) played a pivotal role in ending the Proscription Act so that tartan could be worn again. That same society and other enthusiasts – many based in England – encouraged Highland chiefs to define clan tartans. The craze for tartans truly took off after King George IV’s 1822 visit, during which Scottish nobility (prompted by Sir Walter Scott) hastened to outfit themselves in distinctive tartans to greet the king. In the decades after, numerous tartan pattern books were published (some, like <strong>Vestiarium Scoticum</strong>, of dubious authenticity), and by the Victorian era the idea of specific tartans for specific clans or districts was widely accepted. It’s notable that this codification of tartans happened when Scotland was firmly integrated in the United Kingdom, with encouragement from the British (often English) establishment. What had been a regional Highland folk costume transformed into the <strong>symbolic national dress of Scotland</strong>, with the enthusiastic approval of the English monarchy and public. This demonstrates a kind of cross-cultural fertilisation: English interest helped elevate tartan to a symbol of national identity (for Scotland and Britain), and in turn tartan offered English people a romanticised link to a shared past.</p>
<p>Today, England’s relationship with tartan is largely one of respect and imaginative adoption rather than ancestral claim. Aside from newer creations like county tartans or the St. George’s tartan, most English individuals who wear tartan do so as a celebration of the UK’s collective heritage or fashion preferences, not because they have their “own” centuries-old tartan pattern (as many Scots might with clan tartans). Even so, the emergence of English regional tartans in recent decades shows a desire to localise the tartan tradition. In places like Cornwall and Northumbria, tartans are now a part of expressing local identity – Cornish tartan kilts are worn at festivals and weddings, Northumberland’s check adorns everything from scarves to regional souvenirs. These symbols operate in parallel to flags and other emblems, enriching England’s tapestry of local identities with a pattern borrowed from the Highlands but tailored to English stories.</p>

            <h2>Modern Design Movements</h2>
            

            
            <div class="section-text">
                <p>In modern times, tartan has transcended its origins to become a global fashion statement – and English designers and subcultures have been at the forefront of this movement. One of the most influential figures in reinterpreting tartan through fashion is British designer <strong>Vivienne Westwood</strong>. In the late 20th century, Westwood and her contemporaries in the <strong>punk</strong> movement gave tartan a provocative new role. During the 1970s punk era in London, tartan was appropriated as a symbol of rebellion against conventional British society. Westwood famously incorporated tartan into her punk designs – most iconically, she and Malcolm McLaren introduced elements of the traditional kilt into punk attire. At their Seditionaries boutique, they draped tartan <strong>kilts</strong> over black bondage suits, transforming the kilt from a Highland aristocratic garment into a subversive punk uniform. This included the use of <strong>Royal Stewart tartan</strong> torn, safety-pinned, and reimagined as punk trousers or skirts – effectively giving a “middle finger” to British high society by turning a royal tartan on its head (as noted in one commentary on her work). Through Westwood’s influence, tartan became a staple of punk fashion, seen on iconic punk rock figures throughout the UK. What had once symbolised clan loyalty or royal pageantry was now a badge of counterculture defiance, seen on the streets of London, from King’s Road to Camden. The punk appropriation of tartan is a powerful example of how a traditional design was re-contextualised by English youth culture: tartan’s rules and connotations were upended, yet its visual impact remained – loud, plaid, and impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Beyond punk, tartan has remained perennially stylish. British fashion houses have continually found fresh inspiration in tartan, ensuring it remains in vogue. The luxury brand <strong>Burberry</strong> – an English company – introduced its famous <strong>Burberry check</strong> in the 1920s, originally as a lining for trench coats. This camel, black, red, and white plaid has since become one of the most recognisable tartans in the world, synonymous with British style and the Burberry label. Though not called a “tartan” by the company, the Burberry check is essentially a tartan sett; it demonstrates how an English brand took a tartan pattern and leveraged it for global branding success. In the late 20th century, the Burberry check even developed subcultural associations of its own (both aspirational and, at one point, “chav” street fashion in the UK), showing how dynamic the life of a tartan pattern can be in the public imagination.</p>
<p>Contemporary fashion designers – both in England and internationally – often feature tartan on the runway, especially in autumn/winter collections, as a nod to heritage patterns reimagined in modern silhouettes. British designer <strong>Alexander McQueen</strong> (known for blending his Scottish ancestry with radical fashion) created entire collections around tartan, such as his 1995 “<strong>Highland Rape</strong>” show which used shredded tartan to comment on history, and his later “<strong>Widows of Culloden</strong>” collection (2006) featuring dramatic tartan gowns. Even outside of specifically British designers, tartan shows up in global couture and streetwear: Japanese punk and Lolita fashions incorporate tartan skirts; American preppy style has its own plaid variations; and tartan prints cycle through trends in everything from high-end suits to trainers. In 2023, tartan was celebrated in a major exhibition at the V&amp;A Dundee, highlighting its influence across design, from architecture to anime. The exhibit noted how tartan’s strong grid provides a framework “open to infinite possibility” for designers to play with.</p>
<p>In England today, one might see tartan in the most traditional of contexts – for example, a bagpiper in London wearing a Scottish regimental kilt, or a newlywed couple incorporating a family tartan in their wedding attire – or in the most cutting-edge ways, like a London fashionista pairing a tartan skirt with a leather jacket. The pattern has proven remarkably adaptable. Modern design movements in England have tended to treat tartan as a kind of cultural palette: designers know its historical baggage (rebellion, tradition, clan, kitsch) and exploit those associations to make artistic or political statements. Whether it’s used to invoke nostalgia, as in interior designs that give an English cottage a “Highland cosy” feel with tartan throws, or to shock and subvert, as in punk and high fashion, tartan remains an endlessly intriguing motif. The continual reinvention of tartan by English designers and subcultures underlines a key point: tartan may originate from Scotland, but it resonates far beyond – in England it has been a canvas for expression, innovation, and identity, from the mills of the Industrial Revolution to the runways of London Fashion Week.</p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <div class="section-text"><p>The story of <strong>English tartans</strong> is one of cultural interplay and evolution. What began as simple <strong>checkered cloth</strong> worn by ancient Britons and border shepherds has been reinterpreted over centuries through the lenses of industry, politics, and art. England’s role in tartan history – from preserving it during the 18th-century ban, to <strong>popularising</strong> it in the Victorian era, to creating new tartans for its own regions and fashions – demonstrates how a symbol can cross regional and national boundaries. <strong>English tartans</strong> today encompass everything from the venerable <strong>Northumberland check</strong> (with roots in Roman-era textile craft) to the newly designed patterns celebrating Cornwall’s Celtic spirit or Yorkshire’s community values. They serve as emblems of local pride within England and as tokens of participation in the wider Celtic heritage of the British Isles. At the same time, tartan in English life has become a dynamic element in style and culture: a plaid scarf or skirt can be simply a fashion choice, or a bold statement of rebellion or solidarity, depending on how it’s worn.</p>
<p>Crucially, England’s engagement with tartan has always balanced respect and reinvention. There is respect in the way English enthusiasts adopted Highland dress for pageantry or how modern counties <strong>honour</strong> ancient symbols in their tartans. And there is reinvention in how tartan has been continually repurposed – whether by an English mayor creating a new civic symbol, or a punk designer shocking the establishment with shredded plaid. In merging Scottish tradition with English context, English tartans have enriched the tapestry of British national identity. They remind us that shared symbols can be claimed by many communities, each adding new layers of meaning. Far from being the exclusive province of any one nation or clan, tartan has proven to be a <strong>living tradition</strong> – one that England has helped to weave into its own historical narrative. From ancient checks to punk rock chic, the journey of tartan in England exemplifies how history and culture interweave, creating patterns as complex and enduring as a tartan itself.</p></div>
