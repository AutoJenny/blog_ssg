# CURRENT Priorities: CIPS Development

**Date:** 2025-04-03 *(Updated)*

## 1. Purpose & Context

This document outlines the immediate, actionable priorities for the CLAN.com Integrated Promotion System (CIPS) project. Its purpose is to guide day-to-day development work and provide a quick onboarding reference for collaborators (human or AI) regarding the current focus.

It bridges the gap between:
*   The **Overall Project Plan:** (`Project Plan CIPS.md` - outlining long-term vision, phases, and goals).
*   The **Technical Briefing:** (`Technical Briefing CIPS.md` - detailing the current tech stack, architecture, and key file functions).
*   The **Admin Interface Enhancement Plan:** (`Admin Interface Enhancements.md` - detailing specific UI improvements).

This document should be updated frequently as tasks are completed and new priorities emerge.

## 2. Current High-Level Focus

*   **Blog Publishing MVP:** **(Achieved!)** Core workflow is functional and status-tracked.
*   **Initiate Syndication MVP:** Implement the first basic social media syndication channel (Facebook). **(Current Primary Focus)**

## 3. Actionable Priorities & Tasks

**Priority 1: Implement Facebook Syndication (MVP)**

*   **Goal:** Achieve basic publishing of a post (title, link, key image) to a designated Facebook Page and track its status.
*   **Status:** **Active Development.**
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **1.1. Research & Setup:** Obtain Facebook Graph API credentials (App, Page Token) for posting to the target Page. Implement secure storage for API keys/tokens in `.env` file.
    *   [ ] **1.2. Develop Syndication Function/Script:** Create (`scripts/syndication_utils.py` or similar) a Python function `post_to_facebook(post_details)`:
        *   [ ] Accept necessary post details (e.g., title, live URL, message/summary, path to *published* image file).
        *   [ ] Load credentials from environment.
        *   [ ] Format the post content appropriately for Facebook (e.g., message + link, or image upload + caption). Decide on initial format (link post recommended for simplicity first).
        *   [ ] Implement the Facebook Graph API call using `requests`.
        *   [ ] Handle API response, parse Post ID on success, capture errors.
        *   [ ] Return `(success_boolean, result_data)` where `result_data` is Post ID or error message.
    *   [ ] **1.3. Create API Endpoint in `app.py`:** Define `/api/syndicate/facebook/<string:slug>` (POST):
        *   [ ] Load necessary post metadata and image library data to get inputs for `post_to_facebook`.
        *   [ ] Construct the live post URL (requires `base_url` config).
        *   [ ] Call the `post_to_facebook` function.
        *   [ ] Handle the function's return value (success/failure, result data).
    *   [ ] **1.4. Integrate Status Update in API Endpoint:**
        *   [ ] On success/failure from `post_to_facebook`, load `_data/workflow_status.json`.
        *   [ ] Update the `stages.syndication.facebook` entry: set `status` ('complete'/'error'), store `postId` or `last_error`.
        *   [ ] Save `_data/workflow_status.json` using `save_json_data`.
    *   [ ] **1.5. Add UI Trigger:**
        *   [ ] Add a basic "Post to Facebook" button in `templates/admin_post_detail.html`.
        *   [ ] Add JavaScript to trigger a `fetch` POST request to `/api/syndicate/facebook/<slug>` on button click.
        *   [ ] Display feedback (e.g., success/error message, update button state) in the UI based on the API response.

**Priority 2: Improve Admin UX for Manual Status Updates (Optional but Recommended)**

*   **Goal:** Allow easier manual status updates via the Admin UI.
*   **Status:** **Optional / Deferred.** Can be done alongside or after Facebook MVP. Refer to `Admin Interface Enhancements.md` for details.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] Implement clickable status elements in `admin_post_detail.html`.
    *   [ ] Implement JavaScript fetch calls to `/api/update_status`.
    *   [ ] Implement visual feedback in UI.

**(Completed Items - Moved Down for Reference)**

*   **DONE:** Refine Blog Deployment Script (`scripts/post_to_clan.py`)
*   **DONE:** Integrate Deployment Status Update into Workflow (`app.py`)
*   **DONE:** Standardize Image Handling & Deployment (`scripts/process_imported_image.py`, `scripts/post_to_clan.py`)
