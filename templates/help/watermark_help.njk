<p>This action runs the <code>watermark_images.py</code> script for the current post.</p>
<p>It finds images in <code>images/posts/{{ slug }}/</code> and creates watermarked versions in <code>images/posts/{{ slug }}-watermarked/</code>.</p>
<p>The 'Publish' action currently uses the <strong>original</strong> images unless configured otherwise. This button currently only generates the watermarked files; it does not automatically switch the publishing process to use them.</p>
<p>Ensure image assets are prepared before running.</p>
